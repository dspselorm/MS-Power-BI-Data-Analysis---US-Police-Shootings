I recently completed a data analysis project focused on uncovering insights into the causes behind police shooting incidents in the United States. 
Using advanced tools and techniques, I examined key factors such as demographics, crime rates, mental health, and socioeconomic influences to identify 
patterns contributing to the frequency of these events.

One of the most striking findings was, "a significant correlation between Threat Level (Arms Possession) and the likelihood of police use of force incidents".
This project challenged me to think critically about the underlying issues and highlighted the importance of data in driving conversations around policy reform and public safety.
